Don't apply some boring dampening factor, give each block a friction/resistance value and 
as you step through the boxes take note of the friction value and the distance travelled,
then apply the total dampenned to velocity
Remember this means I'll have to do a bunch of work because 
you can be in multiple blocks at once
